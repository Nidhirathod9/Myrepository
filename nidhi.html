Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything
from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny
footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS,
Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and
multiple workflows.
Some of the basic operations in Git are:
1. Initialize
2. Add
3. Commit
4. Pull
5. Push
Some advanced Git operations are:
1. Branching
2. Merging
3. Rebasing
 This is all about Git.
